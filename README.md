# FDA Nutrient Calculator

#### Project Status: In Progress

## Motivation
1. FoodData Central of USDA (https://fdc.nal.usda.gov/index.html) is an integrated data system that provides expanded nutrient profile data. Although FoodData Central website is easy to use, you realized it is not efficient to manually search foods there for certain food combinations. 
2. Building a pipeline utilizing Python pandas to capture food from a user's meal and provide an output of calculated nutrients. 

## Next Steps
* The current calculator was built using FDC IDs of foods, next steps would be to update the calculator to allow users to input full food word(s).
* Developing a front-end/user interface for users to easily access and use. 
  
## Methods & Technology
* **Language**: Python
* **Data Format**: JSON
* **Data Processing**: Pandas
* **Web Scraping**: Requests
* **Interactivitiy**: iPython Widget
